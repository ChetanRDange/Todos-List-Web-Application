Here's a description you can use for your Git repository:

Todos List Web Application
This is a simple Todos List web application built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The app allows users to add, view, and delete tasks, which are stored locally in the browser using localStorage.

Features
Add Todos: Users can add a new task with a title and description.
View Todos: All added tasks are displayed in a tabular format with a serial number, title, and description.
Delete Todos: Users can delete tasks from the list with a single click, and the list is updated accordingly.
Persistent Storage: The application uses localStorage to save todos, ensuring they persist even after the browser is closed or refreshed.
Technologies Used
HTML5 for the structure of the website.
CSS3 and Bootstrap 4 for styling and responsiveness.
JavaScript for dynamic functionality and interaction with localStorage.
localStorage for persisting the todos across sessions.
This project is a great starting point for anyone learning web development and looking to understand how to create a fully functional web application using basic front-end technologies.
